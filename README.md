# up_emotions_audio
This RESTful webservice aims to extract arousal and valence from audio.
The input argument is either an uploaded audio/video file to the server or a URL. The output is the predicted emotion in terms of Arousal and Valence within the JSON-LD format.

To set up the module, you need:

- change the content of the 'rest_vars' pointing to 'classifiers' directory and an empty 'download' directory.

- define the path to the 'rest_vars' in the er/src/com/opensmile/maven/path.java as 'var_file' value.

- change the directory of 'weka' in the 'classifiers/RF_models/run_*.sh'

- if using your own asr, change the bash commands in 'classifiers/asr/*.sh' file to your own asr service.

Example:

    http://localhost:8888/er/aer/getdims?dims=arousal,valence&url=http://tv-download.dw.com/dwtv_video/flv/wikoe/wikoe20151114_wiruebli_sd_avc.mp4&timing=9,15;147,152

where:

    getdims: desired dimensions separated by comma (arousal,valence)

    url: the url of the video/audio or the name of the uploaded file

    timing: start and end of the segments (in seconds): start1,end1;start2,end2, it can be also 'asr' if ASR is available.


To upload an audio/video file use curl:

    Windows: curl -v -H "Content-Type:multipart/form-data" --user meuser -i -X POST -F "file=@D:\path\to\sample.wav" http://localhost:8888/er/aer/upload

    Linux: curl -v -H "Content-Type:multipart/form-data" --user meuser -i -X POST -F 'file=@./sample.wav' http://localhost:8888/er/aer/upload

Moreover, this repository handles the fusion of audio and video outputs.
